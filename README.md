# Moodle Security Scanner

A comprehensive security testing tool for Moodle Learning Management System.

## Overview

Moodle Security Scanner is a specialized tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in Moodle LMS installations. The scanner implements a range of security tests covering common attack vectors including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), authentication bypasses, API security issues, and more.

**Note:** This tool is intended for legitimate security testing with proper authorization. Unauthorized security testing against systems you don't own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- **Version Detection**: Accurately identifies Moodle version to enable more precise vulnerability testing
- **Authentication Testing**: Checks for authentication bypass vulnerabilities and weak credentials
- **XSS Detection**: Tests for reflected, stored, and DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- **Remote Code Execution**: Identifies potential RCE vulnerabilities including upload bypasses and code evaluation issues
- **SQL Injection**: Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities in GET/POST parameters and forms
- **Local File Inclusion**: Detects LFI vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive files
- **API Security**: Tests Moodle API endpoints for security issues
- **Version-specific Vulnerabilities**: Targets known vulnerabilities based on detected version (where applicable within modules)
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports in HTML, TXT, or JSON formats with evidence and remediation steps

## Installation

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
python moodle_scanner.py -t https://your-moodle-site.com
```

Advanced options:

```bash

- `--version`: Show the version number and exit

## Testing Modules

The scanner includes the following testing modules:

| Module  | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| version | Detects Moodle version information                     |
| auth    | Tests authentication security including login bypasses |
| xss     | Tests for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities         |
| rce     | Tests for remote code execution vulnerabilities        |
| sqli    | Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities                |
| lfi     | Tests for local file inclusion vulnerabilities         |
| api     | Tests API endpoints for security issues                |

## Report Formats

The scanner supports multiple report formats, each providing different levels of detail:

### HTML Report

```bash
python moodle_scanner.py -t https://your-moodle-site.com -o report.html
```

Generates a visually formatted HTML report with color-coded vulnerabilities, detailed evidence, and remediation steps.

### Text Report

```bash
python moodle_scanner.py -t https://your-moodle-site.com -o report.txt
```

Creates a plain text report that can be viewed in any text editor.

### JSON Report

```bash
python moodle_scanner.py -t https://your-moodle-site.com -o report.json
```

Produces a structured JSON file that can be imported into other security tools or processed programmatically.

## Security Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before testing any Moodle installation.
- Use the `--delay` option to prevent overloading the target server.
- Consider using a test/staging environment rather than a production system.
- Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging connections.
- The tool is designed to minimize false positives but review all findings.

## Vulnerability Details in Reports

Each vulnerability report includes:

- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Info classification
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Evidence**: The specific response or content that triggered detection
- **URL**: The exact URL where the vulnerability was found
- **Remediation**: Recommended steps to fix the vulnerability
- **References**: Links to CVEs, CWEs, or other resources (where applicable)
- **Payload**: The test payload that triggered the vulnerability (where applicable)

## Performance Considerations

The Local File Inclusion (LFI) module may take longer to complete as it tests multiple endpoints, parameters, and payloads. To improve performance:

- Use a shorter delay value (e.g., `-d 0.1`)
- Run specific modules instead of all (e.g., `-m version,rce,auth`)
- Use the `--timeout` parameter to set shorter request timeouts
